# Script toolbox and examples

This is where I store my script examples, snippets, and other bits that may come in useful later. 

## Standard disclaimer 

The author is not liable for any terrible mistakes, deleted files, manked systems, or other weird problems that may occur if the user chooses to willfully run a script found on the internet without carefully reading the comments, understanding the contents, and determining if it is, in fact, a good idea to be using. Use at your own risk.

## Running scripts

If necessary, make scripts executable with `chmod 755 [FILENAME]`.

## Python version

All of the Python scripts were written on Python 3.9 or later.

## Lua version

All of the Lua scripts were written with version 5.3 or later.

## System

These scripts were written for use on POSIX-compliant systems (like Linux). Depending on the complexity of the script it may not work, or may have undesireable outcomes. All scripts have been tested on Arch Linux systems at a minimum.
